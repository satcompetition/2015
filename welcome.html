<p>
SAT-Race 2015 is a competitive event for solvers of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. 
It is organized as a satellite event to 
the 
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/sat15/">18th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing, September 24-27, 2015, Austin, Texas, USA</a>
and stands in the tradition of the yearly <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org">SAT Competitions</a> and <a href="index.php?cat=previous">SAT-Races / Challenges</a>.
In contrast to the SAT Competitions, the focus of SAT-Race is on application benchmarks only.

<h3><a name="Objective">Objective</a></h3>
<p>
The area of SAT Solving has seen tremendous progress over the last years.
Many problems (e.g. in hardware and software verification) that seemed to be completely out of reach a decade ago can now be handled routinely.
Besides new algorithms and better heuristics, refined implementation techniques turned out to be vital for this success.
</p>
<p>
To keep up the driving force in improving SAT solvers, we want to motivate implementors to present their work to a broader audience and to compare it with that of others.
